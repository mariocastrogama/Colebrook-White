# Colebrook-White
This repository contains 30 methods to calculate the friction factor of the Darcy-Weisbach equation.  
The turbulent range is calculated using the Colebrook-White formulation.
- Some explicit formulations are presented. 
- These are compared to the friction factor obtained using the implicit Newton-Raphson calculation.  
- If you find a new formulation which is not included, please write to me and I'll include it.
